							<p>Fun little project to build a desk during COVID. After working off of a coffee table for a couple of months, I was ready to upgrade. I decided to get a 
								standing desk, especially with WFH from COVID lasting who knows how long. After shopping around, I settled on the Autonomous Smartdesk 2. It was the cheapest
								standing electronic standing desk that had two motors so that it could change heights quickly. However, many reviews of the desk complained about the desk's tabletop
								saying that it scratches very easily under normal use, as well as the tabletops not shipping properly. For a table that was going to take a month to ship, I did not
								want to deal with these problems, so I decided to just get the base and get my own tabletop for it. 
							</p>

							<p>I noticed many people doing something similar got their tabletop from Ikea. However, I thought their quality wasn't great- their tabletops/kitchen countertops were 
								laminated wood- a thin layer of solid wood on the exterior and particle board on the interior. If I was going to do it myself, I wanted to get something of higher 
								quality, preferably all wood. I also wasn't a huge fan of their dimensions- 48'' length table was too short, and their 72'' length table was too long. 
								Therefore, I went to a local woodcraft store and got a 60''x27'' birch butcher block tabletop. The only downside would be that I needed to finish the wood myself.</p>
								
							<p> To finish the wood, I first filled in any holes using a cheap wood putty. Wood epoxy is a higher end alternative because it blends in better with the wood, but 
								the holes on the tabletop were all on the bottom surface, so I didn't mind using endgrain wood. After letting the putty dry, I sanded the tabletop completely 
								using 120 and 220 grit sandpaper to give it a smooth surface finish. Afterward, I applied several coats of a water-based polyurethane finish 
								(General Finishes High Performance Satin) on it to protect it against any water damage.
								Assembly of the table itself was pretty straightforward- drill pilot holes in the tabletop before screwing it to the base.</p>

							<p>If I was to do it again, I would get the premium version of the desk- the lowest setting of the standing desk is still a little too high for me to work 
								comfortably on it, and the premium version lowers that min height by a couple of inches. I would also get a shop vacuum- although Dysons are great, the wood 
								did clog the filter a bit, and it definitely isn't recommended for woodworking projects. Overall though, a nice product that has drastically improved my day to day working conditions!
